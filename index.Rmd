## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
head(pressure)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data=pressure,aes(x=temperature,y=pressure))
p + geom_point(shape=21,color="black",fill="red",size=5) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
